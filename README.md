## App Description
An app that will allow users to search for other people attending events.

## App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: Users will use the app to connect/find others and discover events near them. Users can message others at the same event.
- Story: Connects local users who share the desire to go to a public event, but are discouraged if their friends can't attend for fear of going alone.
- Market: Made for users who are 18+ because of music festival/concert age and safety reasons.
- Habit: Our app would not be habit forming, as it would only be used when a user is going to a specific event. However, the app should enhance a users experience of an event, influencing them to use the app again.
- Scope: This app includes video chat and direct messaging, a public events page with calendar entries.
